A. Iris is specifically a shaders mod. Other features are not planned for Iris. However, many other wonderful mods have been made by the fabric modding community which cover many of the features of OptiFine. 

The following is a short list, more alternatives can be found through further research, the list is alphabetical.

Better Grass/Snow - [LambdaBetterGrass](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdabettergrass)

Chunk Caching - [Bobby](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bobby)

Bobby is incompatible with Starlight.

Connected Textures - [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)

Custom Item Textures - [CIT-Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)
You need to enable “Broken Paths” or MANY PACKS WILL NOT WORK. 

Dynamic Lights - [LambDynamicLights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdynamiclights)

Smart Leaves - [Cull Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves)

Performance - Iris is already bundled with Sodium but we also recommend [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), [Hydrogen](https://modrinth.com/mod/hydrogen), and [FerriteCore](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ferritecore-fabric). You can also use either [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) or [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight). Phosphor does not have a 1.17 version yet.

Various OptiFine features including toggles for animations, particles, and fog - [Sodium Extra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-extra)

You will also need [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/) and [Fabric-API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) for most mods as well as [ModMenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for settings.
